                                    People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and  anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.

                                    Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how  COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
                                    <br>
                                    Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem.

The first infections were linked to  a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It's important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagios (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.

                                    Coronavirus are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person thought respiratory droplets. currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating it is important to always  wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                                    In general, because  of poor survivability of these coronavirus on surfaces, there is likely vary low risk of spread  from food products or packaging that  are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperature.

                                    If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should: stock up on supplies; take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others; when you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick; limit close contact and wash your hands often; and avoid crowds, cruise travel, and non-essential travel. If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.

                                    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patient may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don't develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develop difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

State and local public health department have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufactures. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficulty to find someplace to get tested.

                                    This is a new virus and we are still learing about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in childern. Most illness, uncluding serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that imoact your child's school, the school may dismiss students. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If school are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.

                                    There is no person to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, Regardless of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect yourself of the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.

                                    To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infect person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.

Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.

                                    Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.

                                    However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 20and 100 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.

                                    No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcai vaccine and Haemoohilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.

                                    <br>
                                    The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.

                                    Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illness is highly recommended to protect your health.
